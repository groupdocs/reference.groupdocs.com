## ISO property


A file with .iso extension is an uncompressed archive disk image file that represents the contents of entire data on an optical disc such as CD or DVD. Based on the ISO-9660 standard, the ISO image file format contains the disc data along with the filesystem information that is stored in it.
Learn more about this file format [here](https://docs.fileformat.com/compression/iso/).
