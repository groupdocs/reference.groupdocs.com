## THREE_MF property


3MF, 3D Manufacturing Format, is used by applications to render 3D object models to a variety of other applications, platforms, services and printers. It was built to avoid the limitations and issues in other 3D file formats, like STL, for working with the latest versions of 3D printers.
Learn more about this file format [here](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf).
