## OLM property


A file with .olm extension is a Microsoft Outlook file for Mac Operating System. An OLM file stores email messages, journals, calendar data, and other types of application data. These are similar to PST files used by Outlook on Windows Operating System. However, OLM files created by Outlook for Mac can’t be opened in Outlook for Windows.
