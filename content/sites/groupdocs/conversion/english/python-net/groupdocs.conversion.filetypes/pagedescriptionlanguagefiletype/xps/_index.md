## XPS property


An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. This format was developed by Microsoft as a replacement of EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document.
Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/page-description-language/xps).
