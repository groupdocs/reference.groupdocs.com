## What is an Image Signature?

An **image** as a signature is an alternative way to put any presenting data in a visual form. This electronic signature type allows the creation of custom images with a company logo, sender's initials, names and so forth.

![Images](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/images/esign-document-with-image-signature.png)

[**GroupDocs.Signature for Python via .NET**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net) provides the [ImageSignOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/imagesignoptions) class to specify different settings for image signature such as image content by file or stream, location, colors and advanced effects.

Here are the steps to create an image signature on a document page:

* Create a new instance of the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class and pass the source document path as a constructor parameter;
* Instantiate the [ImageSignOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/imagesignoptions) object according to your requirements and specify Image signature options;
* Call the [Sign](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/sign/) method of the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class instance and pass the [ImageSignOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/imagesignoptions) to it.

## How to eSign Document with Image Signature

This example shows how to sign a PDF document with the image signature using Python:

{{< tabs "example-1" >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import ImageSignOptions
import groupdocs.signature.domain as gsd
import sys 
import os

def run():
    with signature.Signature("./sample.pdf") as sign:
        # Create image signature options
        image_options = ImageSignOptions("./signature.jpg")
        
        # Set signature position
        image_options.left = 100
        image_options.top = 100
        
        # Set signature size
        image_options.width = 100
        image_options.height = 100
        
        # Set signature opacity
        image_options.opacity = 0.8
        
        # Set signature rotation angle
        image_options.rotation_angle = 45
        
        # Set signature alignment
        image_options.horizontal_alignment = gsd.HorizontalAlignment.CENTER
        image_options.vertical_alignment = gsd.VerticalAlignment.CENTER
        
        # Set signature border
        image_options.border_visiblity = True
        image_options.border_dash_style = gsd.DashStyle.DASH
        image_options.border_color = gsd.Color.BLACK
        image_options.border_weight = 2
        
        # Sign document
        sign.sign("./SampleSigned.pdf", image_options)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.pdf" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [sample.pdf](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-image-signature/sample.pdf)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "signature.jpg" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [signature.jpg](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-image-signature/signature.jpg)

### Advanced Image Signature Options

You can customize the image signature further with additional options:

{{< tabs "example-2" >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import ImageSignOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("sample.pdf") as sign:
    # Create image signature options
    image_options = ImageSignOptions("signature.jpg")
    
    # Set signature position and size
    image_options.left = 100
    image_options.top = 100
    image_options.width = 200
    image_options.height = 100
    
    # Set advanced options
    image_options.opacity = 0.8
    image_options.rotation_angle = 45
    
    # Set image alignment
    image_options.horizontal_alignment = signature.HorizontalAlignment.CENTER
    image_options.vertical_alignment = signature.VerticalAlignment.CENTER
    
    # Add border
    image_options.border_color = signature.Color.BLACK
    image_options.border_style = signature.DashStyle.SOLID
    image_options.border_width = 2
    
    # Sign document
    sign.sign("SampleSigned.pdf", image_options)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.pdf" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [sample.pdf](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-image-signature/sample.pdf)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "signature.jpg" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [signature.jpg](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-image-signature/signature.jpg)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Loading Image from Stream

You can also load the signature image from a stream:

{{< tabs "example-3" >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import ImageSignOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("sample.pdf") as sign:
    # Load image from stream
    with open("signature.jpg", "rb") as image_stream:
        # Create image signature options
        image_options = ImageSignOptions(image_stream)
        
        # Set signature position
        image_options.left = 100
        image_options.top = 100
        
        # Sign document
        sign.sign("SampleSigned.pdf", image_options)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.pdf" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [sample.pdf](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-image-signature/sample.pdf)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "signature.jpg" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [signature.jpg](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-image-signature/signature.jpg)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Summary
