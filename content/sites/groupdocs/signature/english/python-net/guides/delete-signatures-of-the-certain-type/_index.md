## Overview
[**GroupDocs.Signature**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net) provides ability to delete signatures of the certain type from the documents over [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method.  
Please be aware that [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method modifies the same document that was passed to constructor of [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class.

## How to delete signatures of the certain type from the document
Here are the steps to delete signatures of the certain type from the document with GroupDocs.Signature:

* Create new instance of [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class and pass source document path as a constructor parameter;
* Instantiate [SearchOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/searchoptions) object with desired properties;
* Call [Search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/search) method to obtain list of signatures;
* Select from list signature object(s) that should be removed from the document;
* Call [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) object [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method and pass one or several signatures to it.  

This example shows how to delete signatures of the certain type that was found using [Search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/search) method.

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import SearchOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("signed.docx") as sign:
    # Create search options
    options = SearchOptions()
    
    # Search for signatures in the document
    signatures = sign.search(options)
    
    if len(signatures) > 0:
        # Get first signature
        signature_to_delete = signatures[0]
        result = sign.delete(signature_to_delete)
        
        if result:
            print(
                f"Signature of type {signature_to_delete.signature_type} "
                f"was deleted from document ['{fileName}']."
            )
        else:
            print(
                f"Signature was not deleted from the document! "
                f"Signature of type {signature_to_delete.signature_type} "
                f"was not found!"
            )
```
