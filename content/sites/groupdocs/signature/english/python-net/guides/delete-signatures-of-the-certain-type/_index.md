## Overview
[**GroupDocs.Signature**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net) provides ability to delete signatures of the certain type from the documents over [delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method.  
Please be aware that [delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method modifies the same document that was passed to constructor of [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class, so the example below copies the signed document first and deletes the signatures from the copy.

## How to delete signatures of the certain type from the document
Here are the steps to delete signatures of the certain type from the document with GroupDocs.Signature:

* Create new instance of [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class and pass source document path as a constructor parameter;
* Call [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) object [delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method and pass the [SignatureType](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.domain/signaturetype/) of the signatures to remove, for example `SignatureType.TEXT`;
* Check the returned [DeleteResult](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.domain/deleteresult/): its `succeeded` list holds the deleted signatures and `failed` holds the signatures that could not be deleted.

This example shows how to delete all text signatures from the document. Only the signatures that GroupDocs.Signature added are deleted; the document's own text stays as it is.

```python
import shutil

from groupdocs.signature import Signature
from groupdocs.signature.domain import SignatureType

def delete_signatures_by_type():
    # delete() saves the changes into the opened document, so work on a copy
    shutil.copy("signed.docx", "all_text_signatures_deleted.docx")

    with Signature("all_text_signatures_deleted.docx") as signature:
        # Delete every text signature in the document
        result = signature.delete(SignatureType.TEXT)
        print(f"Deleted {len(result.succeeded)} text signature(s), {len(result.failed)} failed")
        for number, deleted in enumerate(result.succeeded, 1):
            print(f"  #{number}: '{deleted.text}' (id {deleted.signature_id})")
