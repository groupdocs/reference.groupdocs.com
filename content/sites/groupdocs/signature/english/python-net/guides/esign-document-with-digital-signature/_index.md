## Introduction

In today's digital age, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of electronic documents is crucial. One highly effective method for achieving this is through the use of digital signatures. In this guide, we will explore the world of digital signatures, explaining what they are, why they are essential, and how you can utilize GroupDocs.Signature for Python via .NET to seamlessly eSign your documents.

## What is a Digital Signature?

A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism for verifying the authenticity and integrity of electronic documents. It provides strong assurance that the document originated from a known sender and has not been tampered with by unauthorized sources. Digital signatures are typically represented by certificates containing private (for signing) and public (for verification) keys. Various public key cryptography standards, such as PFX format, are commonly used for this purpose.
The picture below shows how a digital signature looks on a PDF document page by default.

## Why Use Digital Signatures?

- **Enhanced Security:** Digital signatures provide a higher level of document security, making it extremely challenging for unauthorized parties to alter the content.
- **Authentication:** They offer a reliable way to verify the identity of the document sender.
- **Non-repudiation:** Digital signatures prevent senders from denying the authenticity of the signed document.

## How to Sign a Document with a Digital Signature

**[GroupDocs.Signature for Python via .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net)** supports the creation of digital signatures based on existing PFX certificates. To specify various settings the library provides the [DigitalSignOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/) class that allows adjusting digital signature properties in the document:

* The [certificate_file_path](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/certificate_file_path/) or [certificate_stream](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/certificate_stream/) properties define the certificate source;
* The [password](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/password/) property specifies the certificate password;
* The [contact](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/contact/), [reason](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/reason/) and [location](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/location/) properties specify additional descriptions;
* The [visible](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/visible/) property specifies whether the signature should be visible on the document page or not;
* The [xades_type](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/xades_type/) property defines whether the e-signature should be of an XML Advanced Electronic Signature type.

### Follow these steps to sign your documents with a digital signature

1. Install the GroupDocs.Signature package using pip:
```bash
pip install groupdocs-signature
```

2. Create a new instance of the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class and pass the source document path as a constructor parameter.
3. Instantiate the [DigitalSignOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/) object with the required certificate and its password.
4. Call the [Sign](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/sign/) method of the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class instance and pass the [DigitalSignOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/digitalsignoptions/) to it.

The example below shows how to sign a PDF document with a digital e-signature using Python. We can sign any other supported document format in the same way.

{{< tabs "example-1" >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import DigitalSignOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("sample.pdf") as sign:
    # Create digital signature options
    options = DigitalSignOptions("certificate.pfx")
    
    # Set certificate password
    options.password = "1234567890"
    
    # Optional: setup image file path
    options.image_file_path = "sample.jpg"
    
    # Set signature position
    options.left = 100
    options.top = 100
    
    # Sign document
    sign.sign("sampleSigned.pdf", options)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.pdf" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [sample.pdf](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-digital-signature/sample.pdf)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.jpg" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [sample.jpg](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-digital-signature/sample.jpg)

### Advanced Digital Signature Options

You can customize the digital signature further with additional options:

{{< tabs "example-2" >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import DigitalSignOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("sample.pdf") as sign:
    # Create digital signature options
    options = DigitalSignOptions("certificate.pfx")
    
    # Set certificate password
    options.password = "1234567890"
    
    # Set signature appearance
    options.visible = True
    options.image_file_path = "signature.jpg"
    
    # Set signature position and size
    options.left = 100
    options.top = 100
    options.width = 200
    options.height = 100
    
    # Set additional information
    options.contact = "John Smith"
    options.reason = "Approval"
    options.location = "New York"
    
    # Set XAdES type
    options.xades_type = signature.XAdESType.XAdES
    
    # Sign document
    sign.sign("sampleSigned.pdf", options)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.pdf" >}}

The following sample file is used in this example: [sample.pdf](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/basic-usage/electronic-signature-types/esign-document-with-digital-signature/sample.pdf)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "signature.jpg" >}}

### Loading Certificate from Stream

You can also load the certificate from a stream:

{{< tabs "example-3" >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import DigitalSignOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("sample.pdf") as sign:
    # Load certificate from stream
    with open("certificate.pfx", "rb") as cert_stream:
        # Create digital signature options
        options = DigitalSignOptions(cert_stream)
        
        # Set certificate password
        options.password = "1234567890"
        
        # Set signature position
        options.left = 100
        options.top = 100
        
        # Sign document
        sign.sign("sampleSigned.pdf", options)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "sample.pdf" >}}
