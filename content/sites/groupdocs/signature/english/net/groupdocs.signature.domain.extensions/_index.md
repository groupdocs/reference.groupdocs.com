The namespace provides extensions for signature appearances and additional functionality.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Address](./address) | Represents address for contact. |
| [Brush](./brush) | Represents base class for various brushes. |
| [CryptoCurrencyTransfer](./cryptocurrencytransfer) | Represents Cryptocurrency transfer (receive or send) for QR-Code. |
| [Email](./email) | Represents Email format for QR-Code. |
| [EPC](./epc) | Represents European Payments Council Quick Response Code. |
| [Event](./event) | Represents standard QR-Code Event details. |
| [FormatAttribute](./formatattribute) | Instructs objects serialization to serialize the member with the specified name and format |
| [LinearGradientBrush](./lineargradientbrush) | Represents linear gradient brush. |
| [MeCard](./mecard) | Represents MeCard standard contact details. |
| [RadialGradientBrush](./radialgradientbrush) | Represents radial gradient brush. |
| [SignatureExtension](./signatureextension) | Represents base class for signatures extensions. |
| [SkipSerializationAttribute](./skipserializationattribute) | Instructs the serialization to skip the member. |
| [SMS](./sms) | Represents SMS short message service details. |
| [SolidBrush](./solidbrush) | Represents solid brush. It could be used instead background color property. |
| [SpreadsheetPosition](./spreadsheetposition) | Defines signature position for Spreadsheet documents. |
| [SymmetricEncryption](./symmetricencryption) | Implements standard symmetric algorithms for data encryption with single key and passphrase (salt). |
| [SymmetricEncryptionAttribute](./symmetricencryptionattribute) | Instructs instances serialization to encrypt / decrypt object serialization string. |
| [TextShadow](./textshadow) | Represents text shadow properties for text signatures. The result may vary depending on the signature type and document format. TextShadow is recommended for using with TextAsImage signature for all supported document types, also with simple TextSignature and TextSignature as watermark for Spreadsheets (.xslx) and Presentations (.pptx). Simple TextSignature for Words (.docx) is recommended too, but has limited functionality. |
| [TextureBrush](./texturebrush) | Represents texture brush. |

| [WiFi](./wifi) | Represents WiFi network connection details. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IDataEncryption](./idataencryption) | Encryption interface to provide object encoding and decoding methods. |
| [IDataSerializer](./idataserializer) | Serialization interface to provide object serialization and deserialization methods. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CryptoCurrencyType](./cryptocurrencytype) | Represents Cryptocurrency type. |
| [SymmetricAlgorithmType](./symmetricalgorithmtype) | Represents symmetric encryption algorithm type. |
| [WiFiEncryptionType](./wifiencryptiontype) | Represents WiFi Encryption type. |
