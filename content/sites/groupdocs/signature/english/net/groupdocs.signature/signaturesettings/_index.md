| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DefaultCulture](../../groupdocs.signature/signaturesettings/defaultculture) { get; set; } | Gets or sets default culture to be used during document processing. Default value is "en-US". |
| [IncludeStandardMetadataSignatures](../../groupdocs.signature/signaturesettings/includestandardmetadatasignatures) { get; set; } | Gets or sets flag to include into the Metadata List the embedded standard document metadata signatures like Author, Owner, document creation date, modified date, etc. If this flag is set to false (by default) the GetDocumentInfo will not include these metadata signatures. When this flag is set to true the document information will include these standard metadata signatures. |
| [Logger](../../groupdocs.signature/signaturesettings/logger) { get; } | The logger implementation used for logging (Errors, Warnings, Traces). [`ILogger`](../../groupdocs.signature.logging/ilogger). |

| [SaveDocumentOnEmptyDelete](../../groupdocs.signature/signaturesettings/savedocumentonemptydelete) { get; set; } | Gets or sets flag to re-save source document when Delete method has no affected signatures to remove. If this flag is set to true (by default) document will be saving with corresponding history process log (date and operation type) even if Delete method has no signatures to remove. When this flat is set to false source document will not be modified at all. |
| [SaveDocumentOnEmptyUpdate](../../groupdocs.signature/signaturesettings/savedocumentonemptyupdate) { get; set; } | Gets or sets flag to re-save source document when Update method has no signatures to update. If this flag is set to true (by default) document will be saving with corresponding history process log (date and operation type) even if Update method has no signatures to update. When this flat is set to false source document will not be modified at all. |
| [ShowDeletedSignaturesInfo](../../groupdocs.signature/signaturesettings/showdeletedsignaturesinfo) { get; set; } | Gets or sets flag that includes deleted signatures into Document Info result. Each Signature [`BaseSignature`](../../groupdocs.signature.domain/basesignature) has Deleted flag [`Deleted`](../../groupdocs.signature.domain/basesignature/deleted) to detect if it was deleted. |
