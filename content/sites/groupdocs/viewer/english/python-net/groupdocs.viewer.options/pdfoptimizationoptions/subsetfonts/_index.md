## PdfOptimizationOptions.SubsetFonts property

Every font used to display text on the page contains set of glyphs for font characters. PDF specification supports "font subset" i.e. font with only those glyphs which are used. This may cause issues when text should be updated (since probably required glyphs are absent in the font), but for the document which is not planned to change this allows to decrease size.

```csharp
public bool SubsetFonts { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is `false`.

### Examples

The example demonstrates a typical usage of this option.

```csharp
using (var viewer = new Viewer("sample.docx"))
{
    PdfViewOptions viewOptions = new PdfViewOptions();
    viewOptions.PdfOptimizationOptions = new PdfOptimizationOptions 
    {
        SubsetFonts = true
    };

    viewer.View(viewOptions);
}
```
