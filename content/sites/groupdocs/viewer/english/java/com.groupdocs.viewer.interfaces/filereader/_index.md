Declares an interface for reading a file stream.

The FileReader interface provides a method for reading a file stream. It is used for accessing and reading the contents of a file in a sequential manner. Implementations of this interface should handle the necessary operations to read data from a file.

Example usage:

```

 FileReader fileReader = new FileReader() {
     @Override
     public InputStream read() {
         // Create document stream
     }

     @Override
     public void close() {
         // Close the stream
     }
 };
 try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(fileReader, new ViewerSettings())){
     // Process document
 }
 
```
