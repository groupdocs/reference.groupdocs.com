| [CreateResourceStream](../com.groupdocs.viewer.interfaces/createresourcestream) | Represents interface that instantiates stream used to write output HTML resource data. |
| [CreateResourceUrl](../com.groupdocs.viewer.interfaces/createresourceurl) | Represents interface that creates URL for HTML resource. |
| [FileReader](../com.groupdocs.viewer.interfaces/filereader) | Declares method for reading file stream. |
