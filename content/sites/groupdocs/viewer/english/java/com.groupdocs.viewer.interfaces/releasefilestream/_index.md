public interface ReleaseFileStream
```

Releases an interface that was instantiated by the method associated with the CreateFileStream interface.

The  ReleaseFileStream  interface represents a functional interface that declares a method to release a closeable that was previously instantiated by the corresponding method in the [CreateFileStream](../../com.groupdocs.viewer.interfaces/createfilestream) interface. Implementations of this interface should provide the necessary functionality to release any resources associated with the object.

Example usage:

```

 ReleaseFileStream releaseFileStream = (fileStream) -> {
     // Custom implementation to release any resources associated with the file stream
 };

 PdfViewOptions pdfViewOptions = new PdfViewOptions(createFileStream, releaseFileStream);
 // Use pdfViewOptions in Viewer
 
```
