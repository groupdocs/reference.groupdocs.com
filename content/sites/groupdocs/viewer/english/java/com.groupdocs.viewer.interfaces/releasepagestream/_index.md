Implementations of this interface should provide the necessary functionality to release any resources associated with the stream.

Example usage:

```

 ReleasePageStream releasePageStream = ((pageNumber, pageStream) -> {
     // Custom implementation to release any resources associated with the file stream
 };

 PngViewOptions pngViewOptions = new PngViewOptions(createPageStream, releasePageStream);
 // Use pngViewOptions in Viewer
 
```
