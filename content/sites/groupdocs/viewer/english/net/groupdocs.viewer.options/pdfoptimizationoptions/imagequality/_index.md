## PdfOptimizationOptions.ImageQuality property

If the source PDF file contains images, consider compressing the images and setting their quality. In order to enable image compression, set CompressImages option to true. All the images in a document will be re-compressed. The compression is defined by the ImageQuality property, which is the value of the quality in percent. 100% is unchanged quality. To decrease image quality, set the CompressImages option to true and ImageQuality property less than 100.

```csharp
public int ImageQuality { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is `100`.

### Examples

The example demonstrates a typical usage of this option.

```csharp
using (var viewer = new Viewer("sample.docx"))
{
    PdfViewOptions viewOptions = new PdfViewOptions();
    viewOptions.PdfOptimizationOptions = new PdfOptimizationOptions 
    {
        CompressImages = true,
        ImageQuality = 50
    };

    viewer.View(viewOptions);
}
```
