## CadOptions.EnablePerformanceConversionMode property

Setting this flag to `true` enables a special performance-oriented conversion mode for all formats within CAD family — in this mode the conversion speed is much faster, but the quality of the resultant documents is signifiantly worser. By default is disabled (`false`) — the quality of the resultant documents is the best possible at the expense of performance.

```csharp
public bool EnablePerformanceConversionMode { get; set; }
```
