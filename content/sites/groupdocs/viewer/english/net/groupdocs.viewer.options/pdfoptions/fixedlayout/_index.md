## PdfOptions.FixedLayout property

PDF is a fixed format so all of the elements have a specific place on a page. To ensure that the output HTML looks the same as the source PDF the documents are rendered to HTML with a fixed layout by default. When rendering with fixed layout the output HTML has fixed size so the elements will stay on the same place regardless of window size. To render to HTML with fluid layout set this property to `false`.

```csharp
public bool FixedLayout { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is `true`.

This option is supported when rendering into HTML.

When rendering to fluid layout images are skipped. Use fluid layout when rendering PDF documents with textual content.

### Examples

This example shows how to render PDF document to HTML with fluid layout.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Viewer;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
//..

using (var viewer = new Viewer("resume.pdf"))
{
   var viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources("page_{0}.html");
   viewOptions.FixedLayout = false;
   viewer.View(viewOptions);
}        
```
