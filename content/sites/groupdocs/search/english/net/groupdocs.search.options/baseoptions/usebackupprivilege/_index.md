## BaseOptions.UseBackupPrivilege property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the process should use the SeBackupPrivilege and FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS to access files and directories. The default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool UseBackupPrivilege { get; set; }
```

### Property Value

`true` to enable privileged access using SeBackupPrivilege and FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS; otherwise, `false`.

### Remarks

When enabled, this allows the process to bypass file and directory security checks, permitting access to protected resources typically restricted by ACLs — as long as the process has the proper privileges. This feature is only supported on Windows operating systems. On non-Windows platforms, enabling this property has no effect. Note that this requires the process to be running with administrative rights. Use with caution, as it may allow access to sensitive system files and user data.
