**Inheritance:**
java.lang.Object
```
public final class MemoryCleaner
```

Cleans different resources to free memory.

This class provides methods to clear heap memory, delete temp files, and clear font registry information. It also includes a method to safely clear thread-local instances for the current thread.

Example usage:

```

 // Clean heap memory, keeping font settings
 MemoryCleaner.clearKeepingFontSettings();

 // Clean heap memory and delete temp files
 MemoryCleaner.clear();

 // Clean heap memory from static PDF instances
 MemoryCleaner.clearStaticInstances();

 // Delete all temp files created by PDF in the system temp directory
 MemoryCleaner.clearAllTempFiles();

 // Clear font registry information from heap memory
 MemoryCleaner.clearFontRegistry();

 // Safely clear thread-local instances for the current thread
 MemoryCleaner.clearCurrentThreadLocals();
 
```
