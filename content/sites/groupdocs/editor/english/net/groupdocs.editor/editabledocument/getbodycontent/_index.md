## GetBodyContent() {#getbodycontent}

Returns a body of the HTML document (inner content between opening and closing BODY tags without these tags) as a string.

```csharp
public string GetBodyContent()
```

### Return Value

String, which contains the body of the HTML document (without opening and closing BODY tags)

### Remarks

Most of WYSIWYG editors usually operate with the inner content of the BODY of the document and cannot correctly process its meta information from the HEAD block. This method is designed for such cases. This overload doesn't allow to adjust URIs for external resource requests.
