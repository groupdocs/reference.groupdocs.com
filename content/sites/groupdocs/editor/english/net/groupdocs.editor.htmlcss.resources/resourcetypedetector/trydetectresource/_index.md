## ResourceTypeDetector.TryDetectResource method

Tries to analyze an input stream and creates one of supportable HTML resources from it, taking into account a specified assumptive type, if it is not null

```csharp
public static IHtmlResource TryDetectResource(Stream inputResourceStream, string name, 
    IResourceType assumptiveFormat)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inputResourceStream | Stream | Input stream, which presumably contains an HTML resource. If invalid, an exception will be thrown. |
| name | String | Resource name, which will be used for created and returned resource on success. Cannot be NULL, empty or whitespace |
| assumptiveFormat | IResourceType | Assumed format of the input HTML resource, which is useful for achieving the best performance. If completely unknown, use the NULL value. May be incorrect, this will only worsen the performance. |

### Return Value

Instance, which implements 'IHtmlResource' interface and represents one of supportable HTML resources on success, or NULL on failure
