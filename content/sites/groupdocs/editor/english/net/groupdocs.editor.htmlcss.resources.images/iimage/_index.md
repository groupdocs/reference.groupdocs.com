## IImage interface

Image CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image

```csharp
public interface IImage
```

### Remarks

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image CSS reference declares 4 types of images, that can be handled: 1. Images with intrinsic dimensions (a natural size) and thus fixed aspect ratio, that includes all raster images. 2. Images with multiple intrinsic dimensions, existing in multiple versions inside a single file, that includes ICON (*.ico) files. This may be also TIFF, as they support multiple images inside one file, however TIFF format is not supported in web. 3. Images with no intrinsic dimensions but with an intrinsic aspect ratio between its width and height. This includes all vector images, SVG first of all. 4. Images with neither intrinsic dimensions, nor an intrinsic aspect ratio. This includes all gradients.
