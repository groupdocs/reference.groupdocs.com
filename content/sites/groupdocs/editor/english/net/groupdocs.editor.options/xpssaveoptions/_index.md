```

## Constructors

| [XpsSaveOptions](xpssaveoptions)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [OptimizeMemoryUsage](../../groupdocs.editor.options/xpssaveoptions/optimizememoryusage) { get; set; } | Enables memory optimization mechanisms during document generation from HTML, which degrades performance in as a cost of decreasing memory usage. Setting this option to true can significantly decrease memory consumption while generating large documents at the cost of slower saving time. Default is false (memory optimization is disabled for the sake of better performance). |

### Remarks

An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. It was developed as a replacement of EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document.
