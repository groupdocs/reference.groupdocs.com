## SpreadsheetEditOptions.ExcludeHiddenWorksheets property

Allows to exclude hidden worksheets in the input Spreadsheet document, so they will be totally ignored. Default is false - hidden worksheets are available and processed as normal.

```csharp
public bool ExcludeHiddenWorksheets { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Several binary Spreadsheet formats (like XLSX) support hidden worksheets (tabs) concept. Document of such format, if it has more then one worksheet, may contain additional hidden worksheets. By default such hidden worksheets are available for processing, but with this option it is able to ignore them, like these hidden worksheets are absent and don't exist. When this option is enabled, you cannot select hidden worksheet with the '[`WorksheetIndex`](../worksheetindex)' property.
