## SpreadsheetSaveOptions.WorksheetNumbersToDelete property

Allows to specify an array with 1-based numbers of worksheets that should be deleted from the spreadsheet during its saving, in case when the edited worksheet is inserted into existing spreadsheet

```csharp
public int[] WorksheetNumbersToDelete { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When the edited worksheet is saved not as a new single-worksheet spreadsheet (default behavior), but instead is saved into an existing spreadsheet (using [`WorksheetNumber`](../worksheetnumber) property), it is also possible to delete some particular worksheets from this spreadsheet by specifying their numbers in this array.

By default this array is `null` — no worksheets will be deleted. However, when this array is non-null and non-empty, and it contains at least one valid worksheet number, after the output spreadsheet document is generated with the content of the edited worksheet, the worksheets with specified numbers will be deleted from the spreadsheet right before writing its content to the output stream or file.

Worksheet numbers in this array are 1-based, not 0-based, invalid numbers (lesser than 1 or greater than the total number of worksheets) will be ignored.
