## WordProcessingSaveOptions.LocaleBi property

Allows to set override locale (language) for the WordProcessing document for the RTL (right-to-left) text, which will be applied during its creation. When is not specified (default value), MS Word (or other program) will detect (or choose) the document RTL locale according to its own settings or other factors.

```csharp
public CultureInfo LocaleBi { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This option forcibly applies the specified locale to overall RTL text in the document. Do not use it, if document contains different parts of text, which are written on different languages.
