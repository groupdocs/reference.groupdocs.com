## WordProcessingSaveOptions.Locale property

Allows to set override default locale (language) for the WordProcessing document, which will be applied during its creation. When is not specified (default value), MS Word (or other program) will detect (or choose) the document locale according to its own settings or other factors.

```csharp
public CultureInfo Locale { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This option forcibly applies the specified locale to overall text in the document. Do not use it, if document contains different parts of text, which are written on different languages.
