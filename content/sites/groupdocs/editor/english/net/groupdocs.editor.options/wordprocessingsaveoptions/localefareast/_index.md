## WordProcessingSaveOptions.LocaleFarEast property

Allows to override the locale (language) for the WordProcessing document for the East-Asian text, which will be applied during its creation. When is not specified (default value), MS Word (or other program) will detect (or choose) the document East-Asian locale according to its own settings or other factors.

```csharp
public CultureInfo LocaleFarEast { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This option forcibly applies the specified locale to overall East-Asian text in the document. Do not use it, if document contains different parts of text, which are written on different languages.
