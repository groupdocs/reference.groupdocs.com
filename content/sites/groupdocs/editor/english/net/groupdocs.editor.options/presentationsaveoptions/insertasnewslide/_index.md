## PresentationSaveOptions.InsertAsNewSlide property

Boolean flag, which specifies whether edited slide should replace the existing slide in original presentation on the position, specified by the [`SlideNumber`](../slidenumber) property, or it should be injected between existing slide and previous one, without replacing its content. By default is false — existing slide will be replaced. This property is ignored, if value of [`SlideNumber`](../slidenumber) property is set to '0'.

```csharp
public bool InsertAsNewSlide { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

By default slide is replaced. This means that if given presentation has 5 slides, and [`SlideNumber`](../slidenumber)=4, then 4th slide will be replaced with the new edited slide, while the total amount of slides in presentation (5) will remain untouched. However, if value of this property is set to true, the new edited slide will be injected as 4th slide, and all subsequent slides wil be shifter to the end: "old" 4th slide becomes 5th, and 5th becomes 6th, and the total amount of slides in presentation will be incremented by one and equal to 6.
