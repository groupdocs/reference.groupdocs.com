## PresentationSaveOptions.SlideNumbersToDelete property

Allows to specify an array with 1-based numbers of slides that should be deleted from the presentation during its saving, in case when the edited slide is inserted into existing presentation

```csharp
public int[] SlideNumbersToDelete { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When the edited slide is saved not as a new single-slide presentation (default behavior), but instead is saved into an existing presentation (using [`SlideNumber`](../slidenumber) property), it is also possible to delete some particular slides from this presentation by specifying their numbers in this array.

By default this array is `null` — no slides will be deleted. However, when this array is non-null and non-empty, and it contains at least one valid slide number, after the output Presentation document is generated with the content of the edited slide, the slides with specified numbers will be deleted from the presentation right before writing its content to the output stream or file.

Slide numbers in this array are 1-based, not 0-based, invalid numbers (lesser than 1 or greater than the total number of slides) will be ignored.
