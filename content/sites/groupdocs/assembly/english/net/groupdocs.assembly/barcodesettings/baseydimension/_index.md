## BarcodeSettings.BaseYDimension property

Gets or sets a base y-dimension, that is, the smallest height of the unit of 2D barcode modules. Measured in [`GraphicsUnit`](../graphicsunit).

```csharp
public float BaseYDimension { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Barcodes of some types (such as data matrix) may ignore an y-dimension and use an x-dimension for both width and height units.

When barcode scaling is applied through a template, an actual y-dimension is calculated upon the base y-dimension and a scaling factor.
