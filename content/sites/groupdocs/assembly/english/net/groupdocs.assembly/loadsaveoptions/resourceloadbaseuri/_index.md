## LoadSaveOptions.ResourceLoadBaseUri property

Gets or sets a base URI to resolve external resource files' relative URIs to absolute ones while loading an HTML template document to be assembled and saved to a non-HTML format. The default value is an empty string.

```csharp
public string ResourceLoadBaseUri { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When loading an HTML document from a file, its containing folder is used as a base URI by default, which cannot happen when loading an HTML document from a stream. Set this property to specify a base URI when loading an HTML document from a stream or to override the default base URI when loading an HTML document from a file.

A value of this property is ignored in the following cases:

* An HTML document being loaded contains a BASE HTML element providing a base URI.
* An HTML document being loaded is to be assembled and saved to HTML (external resource files are not loaded and relative URIs are not changed then).
