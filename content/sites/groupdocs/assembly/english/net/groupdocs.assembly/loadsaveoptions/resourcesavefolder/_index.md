## LoadSaveOptions.ResourceSaveFolder property

Gets or sets a path to a folder to store external resource files while an assembled document loaded from a non-HTML format is being saved to HTML. The default value is an empty string.

```csharp
public string ResourceSaveFolder { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

By default, when saving an assembled document to an HTML file, external resource files are stored to a folder having the same name as the HTML file without extension plus the "_files" suffix. This folder is located in the same folder as the HTML file. However, this cannot be done when saving an assembled document to an HTML stream. Set this property to specify a path to a folder to store external resource files when saving an assembled document to an HTML stream or to override the default folder when saving an assembled document to an HTML file.

A value of this property is ignored if an assembled document being saved to HTML was loaded from HTML as well (external resource files are not stored and links to them are not changed then).
