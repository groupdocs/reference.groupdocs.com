`EmailContent.attachments` is the collection of files attached to an email message. Each attachment exposes its `name`, `content` (bytes), and `get_document_info()`, and you can add and remove attachments.

## Extract all attachments

  
```python
from groupdocs.watermark import Watermarker
from groupdocs.watermark.options.email import EmailLoadOptions

def extract_attachments():
    with Watermarker("./message.msg", EmailLoadOptions()) as watermarker:
        content = watermarker.get_content()
        print("Attachments:", len(content.attachments))
        for attachment in content.attachments:
            info = attachment.get_document_info()
            print(f"- {attachment.name!r} type={info.file_type}")
            with open(f"./{attachment.name}", "wb") as f:
                f.write(attachment.content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    extract_attachments()
```

  

`message.msg` is the sample file used in this example. Click [here](https://docs.groupdocs.com/watermark/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/advanced-usage/adding-watermarks/add-watermarks-to-email-attachments/email-attachments/message.msg) to download it.

## Add an attachment

  
```python
from groupdocs.watermark import Watermarker
from groupdocs.watermark.options.email import EmailLoadOptions

def add_attachment():
    with Watermarker("./message.msg", EmailLoadOptions()) as watermarker:
        content = watermarker.get_content()
        with open("./sample.docx", "rb") as f:
            data = f.read()
        content.attachments.add(data, "sample.docx")
        watermarker.save("./output.msg")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    add_attachment()
```

  

`message.msg` and `sample.docx` are the sample files used in this example.

## Remove an attachment

The `attachments` collection supports `remove_at(index)` and `remove(attachment)`. Iterate in reverse when removing by index:

  
```python
from groupdocs.watermark import Watermarker
from groupdocs.watermark.options.email import EmailLoadOptions

def remove_attachment():
    with Watermarker("./message.msg", EmailLoadOptions()) as watermarker:
        content = watermarker.get_content()
        for i in range(len(content.attachments) - 1, -1, -1):
            if "sample" in content.attachments[i].name:
                content.attachments.remove_at(i)
        watermarker.save("./output.msg")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    remove_attachment()
```

  

`message.msg` is the sample file used in this example. Click [here](https://docs.groupdocs.com/watermark/python-net/_sample_files/developer-guide/advanced-usage/adding-watermarks/add-watermarks-to-email-attachments/email-attachments/message.msg) to download it.

To watermark an attached document, open `attachment.content` in its own [`Watermarker`](/watermark/python-net/groupdocs.watermark/watermarker/) (via `io.BytesIO`), add the watermark, and write the bytes back — the same pattern shown for [spreadsheet attachments]().
