The complete project [GroupDocs.Watermark for Python via .NET](https://github.com/groupdocs-watermark/GroupDocs.Watermark-for-Python-via-.NET) with code examples and sample files is hosted on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.5–3.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- On Linux, the .NET runtime dependencies: `libgdiplus`, `libfontconfig1`, `libicu-dev`. On macOS: `mono-libgdiplus` (via Homebrew).

## Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/groupdocs-watermark/GroupDocs.Watermark-for-Python-via-.NET.git
cd ./GroupDocs.Watermark-for-Python-via-.NET/Examples
```

## Project structure

```

    └── advanced-usage/     # Loading options, format-specific placement, search & modify
```

## Set up

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Version 26.6.0 is not yet on PyPI (the latest PyPI release is 25.12). Until it is published, `requirements.txt` points at the platform wheel on the [GroupDocs Releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/watermark/python-net/) site. See [Installation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/watermark/python-net/installation/) for the per-platform wheel names.

To run the examples with the full feature set, apply a license. The simplest way is the `GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH` environment variable, which the package applies automatically at import:

```batch
set GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH=C:\path\to\GroupDocs.Watermark.lic
```

```bash
export GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH=/path/to/GroupDocs.Watermark.lic
```

Without a license the suite still runs in evaluation mode — each example runs in its own subprocess, so the evaluation document-load cap is reset per example and the suite stays green.

## Run the examples

Run the full suite, which prints a pass/fail summary at the end:

```bash
python run_all_examples.py
```

You can also run any single example by navigating to its folder and running the script directly — each example uses paths relative to its own folder, and writes its result next to the script as `output.*`:

```bash
cd getting-started/hello-world
python hello_world.py
```

## Run with Docker

The repository ships a `Dockerfile` that builds a Linux image with Python 3.13, the .NET runtime dependencies, and the package preinstalled.

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t watermark-examples .

# Run unlicensed (evaluation mode)
docker run --rm watermark-examples

# Run with a license mounted from the host
docker run --rm \
    -v /path/to/license:/lic:ro \
    -e GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH=/lic/your-license.lic \
    watermark-examples
```

## Continuous integration

The `.github/workflows/` directory contains a workflow that runs the full example suite on every push, on `ubuntu-latest` with Python 3.13. The same matrix is reproducible locally via the `Dockerfile` above.

## Troubleshooting

- **`System.Drawing.Common is not supported` / `libgdiplus` errors (Linux/macOS)** — install the GDI+ library: `sudo apt install libgdiplus libfontconfig1` (Linux) or `brew install mono-libgdiplus` (macOS).
- **Garbled or missing text** — install fonts: `sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer fontconfig && sudo fc-cache -f`.
- **Evaluation limits** — output carries an evaluation watermark and only the first watermark per document is kept. Apply a license (see above) to remove the limits; a free 30-day [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) is available.

## Contribute
