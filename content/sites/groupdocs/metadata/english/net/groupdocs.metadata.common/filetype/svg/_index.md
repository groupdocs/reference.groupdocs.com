description: An SVG file is a Scalar Vector Graphics file that uses XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Textbased description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for building a website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for twodimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome Internet Explorer Firefox and Safari. Learn more about this file format herehttps//docs.fileformat.com/image/svg/.
