## LyricsTag.AdditionalInfo property

Gets or sets the additional information. This value is represented by the INF field.

```csharp
public string AdditionalInfo { get; set; }
```

### Property Value

The additional information.

### Remarks

This is always three (3) characters long in v2.00, but might be longer in a future standard. The first byte indicates weather or not a lyrics field is present. "1" for present and "0" for otherwise. The second character indicates if there is a timestamp in the lyrics. Again "1" for yes and "0" for no. The third character inhibits tracks for random selection - "1" if inhibited and "0" if not.
