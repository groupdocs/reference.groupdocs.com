## suggested_buffer_size property


Gets the suggested buffer size for reading the file.


Generally, this size should be large enough to contain the largest chunk in the file. 
If set to zero, or if it is too small, the playback software will have to reallocate memory during playback, which will reduce performance. For an interleaved file, 
the buffer size should be large enough to read an entire record, and not just a chunk.
### Definition:
