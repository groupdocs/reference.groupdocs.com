## DNG property


DNG is a digital camera image format used for the storage of raw files. It has been developed by Adobe in September 2004.
It was basically developed for digital photography. DNG is an extension of TIFF/EP standard format and uses metadata significantly.
In order to manipulate raw data from digital cameras with the ease of flexibility and artistic control, photographers opt camera raw files.
JPEG and TIFF formats store images that are processed by the camera, therefore, not much room for alteration is available in such formats.
