The WordProcessingFormat type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| UNKNOWN | The format is not recognized. |
| DOC | Represents the .DOC Word format.<br/>Files with .doc extension represent documents generated by Microsoft Word or other word processing applications in binary file format.<br/>The extension was initially used for plain text documentation on several different operating systems. It can contain several different types of data such as images,<br/>formatted as well as plain text, graphs, charts, embedded objects, links, pages, page formatting, print settings and a lot others.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/doc/). |
| DOCM | Represents the .DOCM Word format.<br/>DOCM files are Microsoft Word 2007 or higher generated documents with the ability to run macros.<br/>It is similar to DOCX file format but the ability to run macros makes it different from DOCX. Like DOCX, DOCM files can be store text, images,<br/>tables, shapes, charts and other contents.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/docm/). |
| DOCX | Represents the .DOCX Word format.<br/>DOCX is a well-known format for Microsoft Word documents.<br/>Introduced from 2007 with the release of Microsoft Office 2007, the structure of this new Document format was changed from<br/>plain binary to a combination of XML and binary files.<br/>Docx files can be opened with Word 2007 and lateral versions but not with the earlier versions of MS Word which support DOC file extensions.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/). |
| DOT | Represents the .DOT Word format.<br/>Files with .DOT extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for generation of further DOC or DOCX files.<br/>A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent files created from these.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/dot/). |
| DOTX | Represents the .DOTX Word format.<br/>Files with DOTX extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for generation of further DOCX files.<br/>A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent flies created from these.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/dotx/). |
| DOTM | Represents the .DOTM Word format.<br/>A file with DOTM extension represents template file created with Microsoft Word 2007 or higher.<br/>It is similar to the popular DOCX file format other than it retains the user defined settings for reuse in case of creating new documents.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/dotm/). |
| ODT | Represents the .ODT format.<br/>ODT files are type of documents created with word processing applications that are based on OpenDocument Text File format.<br/>These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold content such as text, images, objects and styles.<br/>Learn more about this file format [here](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/odt/). |
