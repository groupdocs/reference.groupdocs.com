## WAV property


WAV, known for WAVE (Waveform Audio File Format), is a subset of Microsoft’s Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) specification for storing digital audio files. The format doesn’t apply any compression to the bitstream and stores the audio recordings with different sampling rates and bitrates. It has been and is one of the standard format for audio CDs.
