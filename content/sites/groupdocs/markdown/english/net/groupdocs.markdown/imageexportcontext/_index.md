## ImageExportContext class

Represents the context for image handling during document conversion to Markdown. This context is provided by the library during conversion and contains information about the image being processed.

```csharp
public class ImageExportContext
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ImageExportContext](imageexportcontext)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ImageFileName](../../groupdocs.markdown/imageexportcontext/imagefilename) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name of the image file. This property contains the default filename generated by the library, which you can modify if needed. |

### Remarks

During document conversion to Markdown, the library creates an instance of this class for each image found in the source document. You can modify the [`ImageFileName`](./imagefilename) property if you need to customize the output image filename.

### Examples

The following example shows how to handle image conversion in a custom image export handler:

```csharp
public class CustomImageExportStrategy : IImageExportStrategy
{
    public string ImagesFolder => "images";

    public Stream GetImageStream(ImageExportContext context)
    {
        // Optionally customize the image filename
        context.ImageFileName = "custom-" + context.ImageFileName;
        
        // Create and return a stream for the image
        return File.Create(ImagesFolder + "/" + context.ImageFileName);
    }
}
```
